CodeForge
Hybrid-Intelligence Python Code Optimization Platform

CodeForge is a production-grade code optimization system that transforms inefficient Python code into faster, safer, and validated alternatives.

It combines deterministic AST-based compiler rules with AI-powered rewriting, real benchmarking, safety validation, and mathematical confidence scoring, in one unified platform.


What Makes CodeForge Different

This is not an LLM wrapper.

CodeForge:

Works 100% offline (no AI required)

Uses 12 hand-engineered AST optimization rules

Benchmarks both original and optimized code with statistical rigor

Validates optimizations with a weighted safety system

Calculates mathematically grounded confidence scores

Enhances results with AI — but never blindly trusts it

The AI layer improves the system.
It does not replace the engineering core.



Why CodeForge Exists

Manual optimization is slow.
AI suggestions are unverified.
Static analyzers only detect issues.

CodeForge:

Detects → Transforms → Benchmarks → Validates → Explains

End-to-end.
